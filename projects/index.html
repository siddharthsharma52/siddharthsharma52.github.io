<br>

<b><i>Solar Position Algorithm on Raspberry Pi</i></b><br> 
August 2014<br>
<p style="margin:0.5em">Designed the PCB for a standalone RaspberryPi-based device for the implementation of SPA developed by NREL, US Department of Energy; the device makes SPA calculations, such as solar zenith angle and azimuth angle, at remote locations</p>

<b><i>Bachelor's Undergraduate Thesis Project: Implementing speaker recognition using Student’s t-Mixture
Model</i></b><br> 
January 2014 - June 2014<br>
<p style="margin:0.5em">Mentored by Dr. Smriti Srivastava. Dr. Srivastava is a professor in the Division of Instrumentation and Control, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology (NSIT) and also Dean, Undergraduate Studies, NSIT.</p>
<p style="margin:0.5em">
In a team of three, I developed a robust, text-independent speaker recognition system modelled on
Student’s t-Mixtures. The thesis project was successfully defended and awarded an evaluation of 80%.

<b><i>Summer Research Intern at Viterbi School of Engineering, University of Southern California,
USA </i></b><br>
Summer 2013<br>
<p style="margin:0.5em"> During this internship, I worked in the BioRC research project group led by Dr. Alice C. Parker in the <a class='iframe' href= "http://ee.usc.edu/">Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering</a>. The target of the research group is to mimic the human brain’s neural structure through analog VLSI and nanotechnology. Within the BioRC group,  I was involved with the C.Elegans project team with target to mimic the neural structure of C.Elegans worm.</p>
<p style= "margin:0.5em">
I worked  with Cadence Virtuoso Spectre – the circuit simulation software, and automated the process of neuromorphic circuit design at the research group, bypassing the GUI through python, and Cadence OCEAN scripts. The software prototype we created can be used to connect various analog neuromorphic circuit units (Axon Hillock, Synapse, etc) that had been developed at the research group, according to user's circuit connection information through a text file. When complete, this software would create the 302-neuron circuit of the C.Elegans worm with greater ease, as compared with the effort and time taken for the circuit created through Cadence GUI.</p>
<p style= "margin:0.5em">
We had developed the software prototype for automatic creation of one neuron. The future work of this project is to enable automation of connecting various neurons. For this, machine learning (genetic algorithm) could be applied to calculate "weights" of the various interconnections between neurons. This could be tested using the touch sensitivity neuromorphic circuit of a C.Elegans worm.

<b><i>Research Intern at mLabs Research</i></b><br>
September 2012 - May 2013<br>
<p style="margin:0.5em">Here, I was involved in designing various Arduino and Raspberry Pi based circuits, integrating devices like tft-touch display, 802.11-module, DACs and analog switch matrix microchips by employing bus communication protocols such as SPI and I2C. 
<p style="margin:0.5em">
	I got introduced to memristors and their implementation in the field of neuromorphic circuits and was involved in developing modules for memristor characterization using Arduino. 
</p>
<p style="margin:0.5em">
	I also worked in the hardware development team of the prototype for mLabs' first ever commercial product, Bit-by-Bit (B3) –  a product that enables everyone to design their own Internet of Things enabled hardware. B3 provides a completely automated data acquisition and analysis system, along with an arbitrary waveform generator, using a RaspberryPi-based board. The concept is patented, and is supported by Microsoft Ventures in London.

<b><i>Student Researcher, CEDT Lab, NSIT, New Delhi</i></b><br>
December 2011 - July 2012<br>
<p style="margin:0.5em">As a student at CEDT, I attended lectures Embedded Systems Design and Computer Architecture conducted by Professor D. V. Gadre in the Division of Electronics and Communication, NSIT. I also attended workshops on PCB Design and Fabrication and about working on ARM-based Microcontrollers Using Stellaris Guru Microcontroller Evaluation Kit v1.0.

<br>
  <li>”Pac–Man” on Digital Storage Oscilloscope:
  <p style="margin:0.5em">Working in a team of three, I developed a single player "Pac-Man" game on a Digital Storage Oscillloscope (DSO) as part of Atmel Oscilloscope Design Challenge. The graphic display was established in X-Y mode of DSO using two R-2R ladder-network circuit based Digital to Analog Converter and the gameplay through a basic controller interfaced with Arduino<br>

<b><i>Summer Trainee at Bosch Chassis Systems, Gurgaon, India
</i></b><br>
June 2011 - July 2011
<br>
<p style="margin:0.5em">
	As a trainee, I learned about the various manufacturing processes and protocols
 	employed in the plant. I also learned about the various quality-assurance techniques like Poka-Yoke and Six-Sigma and how they are being implemented in the plant.
</p>

<p style="margin:0.5em">
	I worked on a project titled "Implementation of Poka-Yoke Using Electronics Sensors". During this project I designed the ladder logic circuit for and implemented a panel for Poka-Yoke on a riveting machine in the drum-brake house of the manufacturing plant.
</p>
<p style="margin:0.5em">
	I wrote a review paper with the same title that won First Position (cash prize of 5000 Indian Rupees) at Kriti: Paper Presentation Competition during Innovision 2012, the annual technical fest of Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology

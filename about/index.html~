<p>I'm an <b>Instrumentation and Control Engineering</b> graduate from the <a class="iframe" href="http://nsit.ac.in">University of Delhi, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology</a>. I am a DIY enthusiast and have been tinkering with microcontrollers since my sophomore days. Please go to the 'Projects' section to know more about my research experiences.
I enjoy music and have been playing the bass guitar for a few years now.

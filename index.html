<p>I'm an <b>Instrumentation and Control Engineering</b> graduate from the <a class="iframe" href="http://nsit.ac.in">University of Delhi, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology</a>. I am a DIY enthusiast and have been tinkering with microcontrollers since my sophomore days. My research interests are in circuit design, embedded systems, and machine learning. Innovative and disruptive technologies excite me, and I want to work toward their development.
